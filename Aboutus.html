                <p>
                Pilex Centre was registered July last 2023 and within a twinkling of an eye,
                We are everywhere, tirelessly working to make life better for humanity.
                
                <br>
                <br>
                In the month of September, 2023 we broke into Kaduna Nigeria to profile/ 
                verify Human and Environmental Rights Defenders who had suffered reprisal
                attacks from 2022 to 2023 and we recorded 160 cases of such incidents that 
                led to the death/injury of affected defenders. it may interest you to know that 
                global reporters of such incidents have not been capturing Nigeria and Africa in 
                their yearly reports.
                <br>
                <br>
                Hence the  support from Green Advocates/Mano River Union to undertake
                the said task. We completed that project September 28, 2023 and produced a report 
                which we are yet to publish.
                <br>
                <br>
                Pushing forward into the 2024, We secured our international Pilex Secretariat 
                at 40b Wogu Street D.line, Port Harcourt, Nigeria and hit the ground running 
                with our Legal Trainee program and RIV 3 Project
                (focused on Environmental Impact assessment and litigation in oil and gas extractive 
                sector) sponsored by Advocates for Community Alternative (ACA) AND 
                Public Interest Lawyering Initiative for West Africa (PILIWA).
